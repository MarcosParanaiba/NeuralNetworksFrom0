# Neural Networks From 0
This is a repository for me to study more deeply the understaing the neural networks' structure by not using any library. Hopefully, I will also help you!
## ... why?

You probably are thinking 'why do all that effort? Just use a library!', but, when you try to reconstruct something and understand it's core, you become more proficient in that.
Just like when you understand a physics equation and can use that logic to expand your skills.
So, by doing that Sisyphean task, I hpe that my, and your's, compreension and manipulation of fourther uses of the many kinds of neural cells will be vastly amplified.

<sup><sub>(Btw I'm making that as basically a hobby, updating the code when I manage my school studies...😅)</sub></sup>

## What I have so far
The empty checkboxes are objectives that I already planned (I probably will add more objectives)
